<p>Are you interested in learning the Data Structures and implementing its Algorithms?

The goal of the entire course is to give you capability for writing the code like a professional programmer by understanding the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms.

Here, each section is having theory and examples with its implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms.

There are many people who don't understand the concepts of Data Structures but try to write the code which will result in errors.

This course has the concepts of Algorithm & implementation of the Data Structure concepts with examples but not coding. But by learning the concepts of Data Structures and its Algorithms you can write the code in any programming language.
